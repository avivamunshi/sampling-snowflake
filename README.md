# Sampling techniques in Snowflake

## Introduction
The way we sample data in databases is incredibly important since it directly affects how efficiently queries are processed. Our research highlights just how essential these strategies are for making queries faster and better, especially when dealing with complex operations like joins and group by aggregations.

Understanding these different sampling methods gives database managers, analysts, and researchers the power to make smarter choices when they need to optimize queries. By recognizing how different sampling techniques impact query times, they can pick the best method that suits their database setup. This knowledge allows them to choose the perfect sampling strategy that matches their data and query needs, ultimately making queries faster and more efficient in similar database setups.

## Problem Statement and Method

The question we aimed to address was centered on understanding the impact of various sampling techniques on the performance of queries involving joins and group by aggregations. Specifically, we wanted to investigate how different sampling methods influence query execution times when dealing with diverse types of joins and group by operations.

To explore this, we implemented and compared multiple sampling strategies to gauge their effects on query performance. Our approach involved utilizing three distinct sampling methods: Simple Random Sampling, Stratified Sampling, and Systematic Sampling. Each method was applied across a range of queries involving different types of joins and group by aggregations.

We used a structured methodology wherein we executed queries using these various sampling techniques and recorded and visualized the respective execution times. This empirical approach allowed us to directly observe and analyze the impact of each sampling method on query runtimes for different types of queries in a dataset with 393,000 rows. 

## Results
The observed runtimes for each query are visualized in the results/ directory of this repository. We’ve used a log scale for a better representation of all data points.

## Discussion
We found that Simple Random Sampling caused a significant increase in the time these queries needed to complete. Moving on to Stratified Sampling, the outcomes were quite diverse. While some queries showed minimal changes in their processing time, others encountered substantial delays. However, Systematic Sampling stood out by showing an improvement in query runtimes compared to our usual method. This structured approach had a positive impact, making the queries run more efficiently in this environment.

Let’s talk about why we’re seeing these results now. Simple Random Sampling's inherent randomness leads to an unstructured selection of data points, increasing the likelihood of picking complex or resource-intensive queries. This unpredictability results in heightened runtimes compared to the baseline. Stratified Sampling's runtime fluctuations arise from varying query complexities within different sampling strata. Some queries in certain strata, being more intricate or demanding, increase processing times, while others with simpler attributes experience minimal impact. In contrast, Systematic Sampling's consistent performance is owed to its structured approach. The systematic pattern ensures an organized sample selection, avoiding the randomness of Simple Random Sampling. This structured method tends to select a more balanced mix of queries, enhancing efficiency in Snowflake executions, particularly in joins and group by operations.

## Conclusion

Systematic Sampling, as an example of a structured approach, stands out for its methodical way of picking out specific data subsets for analysis. Unlike Simple Random Sampling, which can introduce randomness and biases in the selection, Systematic Sampling's organized method ensures a more even and consistent representation of the dataset. This careful selection helps lower the chances of accidentally choosing complicated queries, which in turn helps speed up how fast queries run.

Our research emphasizes how crucial it is to think about the way we sample data when we're trying to make databases work better. By using smarter sampling techniques like Systematic Sampling, database experts can make informed decisions that speed up queries and improve how the entire system performs.
